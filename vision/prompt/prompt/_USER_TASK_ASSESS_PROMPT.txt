Look at the screenshot and read the return results of the current task execution.

Overall Task is: {over_all_task} (This is reference only, do not assess overall task)
Current Task(s) are: {task_and_descriptions}
the current execution result is: {result}

Is current task completed? if the task seems correctly executed, please return 'Yes' to continue, if it's not correct and you think there might be chance to replan and do it correctly, return 'Replan' and explain your reasoning. If it's impossible to finish the task or you cannot solve the error, return 'No'.
