The adventurer takes 30 coins, which could be a mix of face-up and face-down coins since he cannot see them.\n3. When he flips these 30 coins, the number of face-down coins in this pile will be equal to the number of face-up coins he initially picked up because their orientation is inverted.\n4. The remaining 170 coins will now have 30 fewer coins in the orientation they were before the adventurer picked up his 30 coins.\n5. Since there were 30 face-down coins to start with, and the adventurer has flipped 30 coins, there will be 30 face-down coins in the larger pile as well.\n6. Both piles now have the same number of face-down coins, so the adventurer has solved the riddle.\n7. For every face-down coin in the adventurer's pile, he is rewarded with two gold coins. Since there are 30 face-down coins in his pile, he wins 60 gold coins."}
