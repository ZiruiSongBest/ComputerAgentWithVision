The rate of decline of net forest loss slowed in the most \n\nrecent decade due to a reduction in the rate of forest expansion.\n\nFAO defines deforestation as the conversion \n\nof forest to other land uses (regardless \n\nof whether it is human-induced). \n\n\u201cDeforestation\u201d and \u201cforest area net change\u201d \n\nare not the same: the latter is the sum of  \n\nall forest losses (deforestation) and all forest \n\ngains (forest expansion) in a given period. \n\nNet change, therefore, can be positive  \n\nor negative, depending on whether gains \n\nexceed losses, or vice versa. \n\nGlobal annual forest area net change,\nby decade, 1990\u20132020\n\nAnnual forest area net change, by decade and region, 1990\u20132020\n\nr\na\ne\ny\nr\ne\np\na\nh\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\nM\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\n-6\n\n-7\n\n-8\n\n-4.7\n\n-5.2\n\n-7.8\n\n1990\u20132000\n\n2000\u20132010\n\n2010\u20132020\n\nr\n\na\n\ne\n\ny\n\nr\n\ne\n\np\n\na\n\nh\n\nn\n\no\n\ni\n\nl\n\nl\n\ni\n\nM\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\n-6\n\n-7\n\n-8\n\n2.4\n\n1.2\n\n0.2\n\n1.2\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n-0.2 -0.2\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.1\n\n-2.6\n\n-3.3 -3.4\n\n-3.9\n\n-5.1 -5.2\n\nAsia\n\nOceania\n\nEurope\n\nNorth and Central \n\nSouth America\n\nAfrica\n\nAmerica\n\n1990\u20132000\n\n2000\u20132010\n\n2010\u20132020\n\n2     Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 Key findings \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fAfrica has the highest net loss of forest area\n\nAfrica had the largest annual rate of net forest loss in 2010\u20132020,  \n\nat 3.9 million ha, followed by South America, at 2.6 million ha. \n\nThe rate of net forest loss has increased in Africa in each of the three decades \n\nsince 1990. It has declined substantially in South America, however, to about half \n\nthe rate in  2010\u20132020 compared with 2000\u20132010.\n\nAsia had the highest net gain of forest area in 2010\u20132020, followed by Oceania \n\nand Europe.2 Nevertheless, both Europe and Asia recorded substantially lower \n\nrates of net gain in 2010\u20132020 than in 2000\u20132010.

The rate of decline of net forest loss slowed in the most \n\nrecent decade due to a reduction in the rate of forest expansion.\n\nFAO defines deforestation as the conversion \n\nof forest to other land uses (regardless \n\nof whether it is human-induced). \n\n\u201cDeforestation\u201d and \u201cforest area net change\u201d \n\nare not the same: the latter is the sum of  \n\nall forest losses (deforestation) and all forest \n\ngains (forest expansion) in a given period. \n\nNet change, therefore, can be positive  \n\nor negative, depending on whether gains \n\nexceed losses, or vice versa. \n\nGlobal annual forest area net change,\nby decade, 1990\u20132020\n\nAnnual forest area net change, by decade and region, 1990\u20132020\n\nr\na\ne\ny\nr\ne\np\na\nh\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\nM\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\n-6\n\n-7\n\n-8\n\n-4.7\n\n-5.2\n\n-7.8\n\n1990\u20132000\n\n2000\u20132010\n\n2010\u20132020\n\nr\n\na\n\ne\n\ny\n\nr\n\ne\n\np\n\na\n\nh\n\nn\n\no\n\ni\n\nl\n\nl\n\ni\n\nM\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\n-6\n\n-7\n\n-8\n\n2.4\n\n1.2\n\n0.2\n\n1.2\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n-0.2 -0.2\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.1\n\n-2.6\n\n-3.3 -3.4\n\n-3.9\n\n-5.1 -5.2\n\nAsia\n\nOceania\n\nEurope\n\nNorth and Central \n\nSouth America\n\nAfrica\n\nAmerica\n\n1990\u20132000\n\n2000\u20132010\n\n2010\u20132020\n\n2     Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 Key findings \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fAfrica has the highest net loss of forest area\n\nAfrica had the largest annual rate of net forest loss in 2010\u20132020,  \n\nat 3.9 million ha, followed by South America, at 2.6 million ha. \n\nThe rate of net forest loss has increased in Africa in each of the three decades \n\nsince 1990.

Such a clear global picture \n\nsupports the development of sound policies, practices and investments affecting \n\nforests and forestry. \n\nFRA is the mechanism for collecting data on two forest-related indicators of the \n\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which the United Nations General Assembly \n\nadopted in 2015. Specifically, data submitted to FRA contribute to reporting on SDG \n\nindicator 15.1.1 (forest area as a proportion of total land area in 2015) and indicator \n\n15.2.1 (progress towards sustainable forest management). \n\nRequired citation: FAO. 2020.

The rate of decline of net forest loss slowed in the most \n\nrecent decade due to a reduction in the rate of forest expansion.\n\nFAO defines deforestation as the conversion \n\nof forest to other land uses (regardless \n\nof whether it is human-induced). \n\n“Deforestation” and “forest area net change” \n\nare not the same: the latter is the sum of  \n\nall forest losses (deforestation) and all forest \n\ngains (forest expansion) in a given period. \n\nNet change, therefore, can be positive  \n\nor negative, depending on whether gains \n\nexceed losses, or vice versa. \n\nGlobal annual forest area net change,\nby decade, 1990–2020\n\nAnnual forest area net change, by decade and region, 1990–2020\n\nr\na\ne\ny\nr\ne\np\na\nh\nn\no\n\ni\nl\nl\ni\n\nM\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\n-6\n\n-7\n\n-8\n\n-4.7\n\n-5.2\n\n-7.8\n\n1990–2000\n\n2000–2010\n\n2010–2020\n\nr\n\na\n\ne\n\ny\n\nr\n\ne\n\np\n\na\n\nh\n\nn\n\no\n\ni\n\nl\n\nl\n\ni\n\nM\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n-5\n\n-6\n\n-7\n\n-8\n\n2.4\n\n1.2\n\n0.2\n\n1.2\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n-0.2 -0.2\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.1\n\n-2.6\n\n-3.3 -3.4\n\n-3.9\n\n-5.1 -5.2\n\nAsia\n\nOceania\n\nEurope\n\nNorth and Central \n\nSouth America\n\nAfrica\n\nAmerica\n\n1990–2000\n\n2000–2010\n\n2010–2020\n\n2     Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 Key findings \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\x0cAfrica has the highest net loss of forest area\n\nAfrica had the largest annual rate of net forest loss in 2010–2020,  \n\nat 3.9 million ha, followed by South America, at 2.6 million ha. \n\nThe rate of net forest loss has increased in Africa in each of the three decades \n\nsince 1990.

On the \n\nother hand, growing stock is increasing per unit area globally and in all regions;  \n\nit rose from 132 m3 per ha in 1990 to 137 m3 per ha in 2020. Growing stock  \n\nper unit area is highest in the tropical forests of South and Central America and \n\nWest and Central Africa. \n\nThe world’s forests contain about 606 gigatonnes of living biomass  \n\n(above- and below-ground) and 59 gigatonnes of dead wood.
