[AKZq] 2024-04-05 22:31:14,094 - INFO - logger.py:83 - [32mTask: Your task is: I have a fun card game that we can play together! Here are the rules: I'll draw a certain number of cards and then arrange them in a certain order in a stack, face down. After I do that, I'll describe a series of steps, and your job will be to keep track of the cards and answer a question about the final ordering.\n\nOkay, from top to bottom, here's the starting layout:\n\n2 of clubs\n3 of hearts\nKing of spades\nQueen of hearts\nJack of clubs\nAce of diamonds\n\nNow, here are the steps I'm taking to jumble up the stack.\n\nI take the top three cards and place them at the bottom of the stack.\nI take the top card and place it under the second card.\nI take the top two cards and place them under the third card.\nI take the bottom card and place it on top of the stack.\nI take the top two cards and place them under the third card.\nI take the top four cards and place them on the bottom of the stack.\nI take the bottom card and place it on the top of the stack.\nI take the top two cards and place them on the bottom of the stack.\nI take the bottom card and place it on the top of the stack.\n\n\nWhat is the top card on the stack? If the card's name contains a digit, write the digit in plain text when answering, e.g. 'six of spades' instead of '6 of spades'.[0m
