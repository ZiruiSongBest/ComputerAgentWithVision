Here we report on genetic analyses confirming the\npresence of the Kam dwarf hamster 500 km north of its known distribution in China where it\nwas earlier thought to be endemic. Our finding was made during a study on disease ecology\nin southern Mongolia and illustrates the benefit of genetic approaches when studying rare\nand elusive species or species that are either difficult to identify or do not elicit public or\nscientific attention. We suggest that larger ranges than currently known may be a common\npattern for a number of rare and elusive species because of ineffective survey methods and\nlack of sampling effort.\nKeywords: conservation, methodology, species distribution, rare and elusive species\nIntroduction\nProper understanding of the distribution and abundance of animals is fundamental for\nmanagement and conservation (Sinclair et al. 2006). However, these parameters are often\ndifficult to establish for rare and elusive species and for species that are either difficult to\nidentify or do not obtain public or scientific attention (González and Barbanti Duarte 2007,\nMcDonald 2013). Nevertheless, recent developments in camera trapping and genetic\nanalyses provide a means to monitor species that have so far been difficult to study\n(González and Barbanti Duarte 2007, Waits 2013). In fact, genetic analyses are especially\nuseful for small species that may not trigger cameras and for species that are difficult to\nidentify visually (Waits 2013).\nThe Kam dwarf hamster (Cricetulus kamensis) has been thought to be endemic to\nwestern China where it occurs in grasslands, shrubby marshes, and open steppes in\nmountainous areas (Smith and Xie 2008). Despite its presumed restricted distribution, no\nimmediate conservation concerns appear to exist for the species and it is categorized as\nleast concern by the IUCN (Smith 2016). However, the taxonomy of Cricetulus is\ncontroversial and both the number of species and the phylogenetic relationships are\ndebated (Nuemann et al 2006, Smith and Xie 2008). IUCN lists 8 species of Cricetulus of\nwhich one is the Kam dwarf hamster (IUCN 2017). In this paper, we report on encountering\nthe Kam dwarf hamster 500 km north of its known distribution and we discuss the benefits\nof genetic approaches when studying rare and elusive species that are difficult to identify.\nMaterial and Methods\nThe observations reported here were made in the Tost Mountains in southern\nMongolia (43° 37’ N, 100° 12’, Figure 1) and was part of a study on disease ecology of snow\nleopards (Panthera uncia) and their prey. The Tost Mountains consists of several mountain\nmassifs that are surrounded by open steppes. The study area is located ca 60 km north of\nthe border to China, ca 50 km south of the Nemegt Mountains of the Gobi Gurvan Saikhan\nNational Park, and is connected to the Great Gobi Strictly Protected Area A via a fragmented\nnetwork of hillocks. The Tost Mountains were declared a Nature Reserve in the spring 2016\nand is part of the Gobi Desert. The sparse vegetation consists of mountain shrubs and\nmountain grasslands. The temperature ranges between -35°C in winter and +35°C in summer\nand the altitude ranges between 1,800 and 2,500 m above sea level. The area hosts\nnumerous small rodents – many of which have similar physical appearance and are difficult\nto identify by eye. Livestock herding is the primary occupation of local people and the\nlivestock comprise of goats (Capra aegagrus hircus), sheep (Ovis aries), camels (Camelus\nbactrianus), and horses (Equus ferus caballus).\nIn June 2012, June 2013, and April 2015, we live-captured small rodents by using two\nsizes of Sherman traps (5.1 ´ 6.35 ´ 16.5 and 7.6 ´ 9.5 ´ 30.5 cm) that were baited with\npeanut butter and rolled oats. Traps were set in locations that showed signs of use by small\nrodents and we checked traps twice daily. We collected a small sample of blood from\ncaptured rodents and cut a small piece of skin from their ear to (1) assure that rodents were\nnot sampled twice (i.e. we did not sample animals that had a notch in the ear) and (2) use for\ngenetic identification of species (see details below). We sexed the animals based on external\ngenitalia and we aged them based on development of external genitalia and size.\nWe performed identification analyses based on genetic markers following Gillet et al.\n(2015). Briefly, DNA was extracted from a piece of ear tissue using the DNeasy extraction Kit\n(Qiagen Inc., Hilden, Germany). An illumina amplicon sequencing was then performed\nfollowing a modified Miseq protocol (Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation). Total\ngenomic DNA of the studied samples were subjected to PCR amplification targeting a ~133-\nbp fragment of the cytochrome oxydase I gene (COI) using a modified forward primer LepF1\n(Hebert et al. 2004) and a modified reverse primer EPT-long-univR (Hajibabaei et al. 2011).\nPurified products were quantified using Quant-iT™ PicoGreen® dsDNA Assay Kit on a\nfluorimeter (FilterMax F3, Molecular Devices). Quantified products were then pooled in\nequimolarity and sent to the GIGA Genomics platform (ULg) for sequencing on an ILLUMINA\nMiSeq V2 benchtop sequencer.\nRaw sequences were processed using a script consisting of a mix of the Fastx-toolkit\n(http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit) and the Usearch function (Edgar 2010). Processed\nsequences were then compared with published sequences in the BOLD databases\n(Ratnasingham and Hebert 2007) where we considered sequences that had identity scores of\n≥98% to be positive matches.\nResults\nOur genetic analyses showed that 5 of 142 rodents captured and samples during 5,040\ntrap-nights were the Kam dwarf hamster with up to 99% homology with the sequences in\nthe BOLD database. This extends the range of the species by about 500 km to the north of its\nknown distribution in China (Figure 1). All five of the hamsters appeared to be in good\ncondition and we captured both female and male hamsters (Table 1). Other Cricetulus\nspecies captured during this study were the long-tailed dwarf hamster (Cricectulus\nlongicaudatus) and the grey dwarf hamster (Cricetulus migratorius) with 60 and 30\nindividuals captured, respectively. We have added the COI sequences of the 5 Kam dwarf\nhamsters encountered during this study to GenBank (number XXXXX).\nDiscussion\nKnowledge on the distribution and abundance of animals is crucial for management\nand conservation (Sinclair et al. 2006). Here our observation of the Kam dwarf hamster in\nsouthern Mongolia not only extends the range of the species about 500 km to the north and\nshows that it is not endemic to China but also illustrates the benefits of genetic approaches\nwhen studying rare and elusive species or species that are difficult to identify or does not\nobtain public or scientific attention (González and Barbanti Duarte 2007, Waits 2013). In\nfact, genetic approaches may be the only technique available to monitor small animals that\nmay not trigger cameras or are difficult to identify by eye (Waits 2013) and we suggest that\nthe knowledge on such animals can be enhanced significantly by using genetic tools.\nHowever, the taxonomy of Cricetulus is debated (Nuemann et al 2006, Smith and Xie 2008)\nand we stress the importance of proper sampling techniques and analyses as well as clear\ninformation to which genetic sequences the data were compared to avoid sample\ncontamination and analytical pitfalls that may result in wrong conclusions (Waits and\nPaetkau 2005).\nOur observation of the Kam dwarf hamster 500 km north of its known distribution\nsuggest that the hamster occurs also in other areas outside its known distribution but has\nnot been detected because of ineffective survey methods or lack of sampling effort (sensu\nMcDonald 2013). Similarly, we suggest that this may be a common pattern for a number of\nrare and elusive species that still remain to be detected outside their presumed ranges. Here\nrecent development in camera trapping and genetic techniques provide us with new tools to\nmonitor animals that have so far been difficult to study (González and Barbanti Duarte 2007,\nWaits 2013) and we predict that we will see an increase in the knowledge on rare and\nelusive species in the near future that will be important for the conservation of these\nspecies.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank David Shepherd Wildlife Foundation, Helsinki Zoo, James Cook University,\nPartnership Funding by Fondation Segré managed by Whitley Fund for Nature, Snow\nLeopard Network, and Winifred Violet Scott Charitable Trust for financial support.\nReferences\nEdgar R.C. 2010.
