# Zhiyong Wu Research Scientist Shanghai AI Laboratory Email: a@b, a=whucs2013wzy b=gmail.com] [Github] [Google Scholar] About me Hi! I am a research scientist at Shanghai AI Lab. I got my PhD degree from the University of Hong Kong at the end of 2021, affiliated with the HKU database group and NLP group. I am advised by Prof. Ben Kao. I am also working closely with Dr. Lingpeng Kong. Before that, I received my B.E. degree from the Dept. of Computer Science at Wuhan University in 2017. Throughout my graduate studies, I had great internships in Tencent AI Lab and Huawei Noah's Ark Lab. Hiring We have multiple full-time/internship positions available (focus on language agent and multilingual LLM), please feel free to hit me up with your CV or questions if interested. Research I am boardly interested in different topics in NLP. But at the moment, my research focus on exploring interesting (sometimes surprising) utilities of large language models: To synthesis datasets without human annotation. (ZeroGen, ProGen, SunGen) To explain model decision via natural language generation. (Neon, EIB) To learn a task without training by conditioning on in-context examples. (SAIL, CEIL, EvaLM, survey, OpenICL) I'm currently obsessed with the idea of \"LLM-powered autonomous agents\" and have multiple related projects underway. If you are also interested in this topic and have a plan to do an internship, feel free to hit me up via email.
