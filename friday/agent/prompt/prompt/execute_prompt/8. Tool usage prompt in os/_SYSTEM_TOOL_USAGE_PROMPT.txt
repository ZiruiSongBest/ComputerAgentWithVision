by using the provided ToolRequestUtil tool. The API documentation is as follows: 
{openapi_doc}
The user-specified task is as follows: 
{tool_sub_task}
The context which can further help you to determine the params of the API is as follows:

"""
:param api_path: the path of the API
:param method: get/post
