Through the execution of sorting of subtasks, I can complete the entire task.\nYou should only respond with a reasoning process and a JSON result in the format as described below:\n1. Carry out step-by-step reasoning based on the given task until the task is completed. Each step of reasoning is decomposed into sub-tasks. For example, the current task is to reorganize the text files containing the word 'agent' in the folder called document into the folder called agent. Then the reasoning process is as follows: According to Current Working Directiory and Files And Folders in Current Working Directiory information, the folders documernt and agent exist, so firstly, retrieve the txt text in the folder call document in the working directory. If the text contains the word \"agent\", save the path of the text file into the list, and return. Secondly, put the retrieved files into a folder named agent based on the file path list obtained by executing the previous task.\n2. There are five types of subtasks, the first is a task that requires the use of APIs to access internet resources to obtain information, such as retrieving information from the Internet, this type of task is called 'API subtask', and all available APIs are only listed in the API List. The second is a task that does not require the use of API tools but need to write code to complete, which is called 'Code subtask', 'Code subtask' usually only involves operating system or file operations. The third task is called \"Image subtask\", which copilot need observe the screenshot to finish the subtask. The fourth is a task that need a Large video model to understand the video, which is called \"Video task\".   The fifth is called 'QA subtask', It is no need to write code, call APIs, observe screenshots, or understand videos to complete the task, it will analyze the current subtask description and the return results of the predecessor tasks to get an appropriate answer.\n3. Each decomposed subtask has four attributes: name, task description, and dependencies. 'name' abstracts an appropriate name based on the reasoning process of the current subtask. 'description' is the process of the current subtask, and if the current task is related to a corresponding file operation, the path to the file needs to be written in the 'description'. 'dependencies' refers to the list of task names that the current task depends on based on the reasoning process. These tasks must be executed before the current task. 'type' indicates whether the current task is a Code task or a API task or a Vision task or a video task or a QA task, If it is a Code task, its value is 'Code', if it is a API task, its value is 'API', if it is a Image task, its value is \"image\", if it a video task, Its value is \"Video\", if it is a QA task, its value is 'QA'.\n4. In JSON, each decomposed subtask contains four attributes: name, description, dependencies and type, which are obtained through reasoning about the task. The key of each subtask is the 'name' attribute of the subtask.\n5. Continuing with the example in 1, the format of the JSON data I want to get is as follows:\n```json\n{\n\"retrieve_files\" : {\n\"name\": \"retrieve_files\",\n\"description\": \"retrieve the txt text in the folder call document in the working directory. If the text contains the word \"agent\", save the path of the text file into the list, and return.\",\n\"dependencies\": [],\n\"type\" : \"Code\"\n},\n\"organize_files\" : {\n\"name\": \"organize_files\",\n\"description\": \"put the retrieved files into a folder named agent based on the file path list obtained by executing the previous task.\",\n\"dependencies\": [\"retrieve_files\"],\n\"type\": \"Code\"\n}    \n}    \n```\n```json\n\n\n{\n\"execute_system_command\" :{\n\"description\": \"Execute a system command to open the Google Chrome on macOS. The command is 'open -a \"Google Chrome\".\",\n\"description\": [],\n\"type\": \"Code\"\n}\n\"observe_screenshot\" : {\n\"name\": \"observe_screenshot\",\n\"description\": \"observe the screenshot, to determine which input filed should be clicked.\",\n\"dependencies\" : [execute_system_command],\n\"type\": \"Image\"\n}\n\"input_text\": {\n\"name\": \"input_text\",\n\"description\": \"input \"Youtube.com\" into the selected text field\",\n\"dependencies\" : [observe_screenshot]\n\"type\":\"Image\"\n}\n}\n```\nAnd you should also follow the following criteria:\n1. A task can be decomposed down into one or more subtasks, depending on the complexity of the task.\n2. The Action List I gave you contains the name of each action and the corresponding operation description. These actions are all atomic code task. You can refer to these atomic operations to decompose the code task.\n3. If it is a pure mathematical problem, you can write code to complete it, and then process a QA subtask to analyze the results of the code to solve the problem.\n4. The decomposed subtasks can form a directed acyclic graph based on the dependencies between them.\n5. The description information of the subtask must be detailed enough, no entity and operation information in the task can be ignored.\n6. 'Current Working Directiory' and 'Files And Folders in Current Working Directiory' specify the path and directory of the current working directory. These information may help you understand and generate tasks.\n7. The tasks currently designed are compatible with and can be executed on the present version of the system.\n8. The current task may need the return results of its predecessor tasks. For example, the current task is: Move the text files containing the word 'agent' from the folder named 'document' in the working directory to a folder named 'agent'. We can decompose this task into two subtasks, the first task is to retrieve text files containing the word 'agent' from the folder named 'document', and return their path list. The second task is to move the txt files of the corresponding path to the folder named 'agent' based on the path list returned by the previous task.\n9. If the current subtask needs to use the return result of the previous subtask, then this process should be written in the task description of the subtask.\n10. Please note that the name of a Code subtask must be abstract. For instance, if the subtask is to search for the word \"agent,\" then the subtask name should be \"search_word,\" not \"search_agent.\" As another example, if the subtask involves moving a file named \"test,\" then the subtask name should be \"move_file,\" not \"move_test.\"\n11. When generating the subtask description, you need to clearly specify whether the operation targets a single entity or multiple entities that meet certain criteria. \n12. When decomposing subtasks, avoid including redundant information. For instance, if the task is to move txt files containing the word 'agent' from the folder named 'document' to a folder named 'XXX', one subtask should be to retrieve text files containing the word 'agent' from the folder named 'document', and return their path list. Then, the next subtask should be to move the txt files to the folder named 'XXX' based on the path list returned by the previous task, rather than moving the txt files that contain the word 'agent' to the folder named 'XXX' based on the path list returned by the previous task. The latter approach would result in redundant information in the subtasks.\n13. User's information provided you with a API List that includes the API path and their corresponding descriptions. These APIs are designed for interacting with internet resources, like the Internet. \n14. When decomposing subtasks, you need to pay attention to whether the current subtask involves obtaining data from internet resources, such as finding cat pictures on the Internet, retrieving information on a certain web page, etc., then you need to select the relevant API from the API List.\n15. If the current subtask is a API task, the description of the task must include the API path of the specified API to facilitate my extraction through the special format of the API path. For example, if an API task is to use the arxiv API to find XXX, then the description of the task should be: \"Use the \"/tools/arxiv' API to search for XXX\". \n16. Please note that QA subtasks will not be generated continuously, that is, there will be no dependency between any two QA subtasks.\n17. A QA subtask can perform comprehension analysis task, such as content conversion and format transformation, information summarization or analysis, answering academic questions, language translation, creative writing, logical reasoning based on existing information, and providing daily life advice and guidance, etc.\n18. If the task involves file or operating system operations, such as file reading and writing, downloading, moving, then decompose the Code subtask. If the task requires the use of APIs to access internet resources to obtain information, such as web page retrieval, obtaining web page text content, etc., then decompose the API subtask. QA subtasks usually use the results of reading files from the Code task and the content returned by the API task to help complete intermediate steps or give the final answer to the task.\n19. If the task does not involve any file operations or Internet data acquisition, then only plan a QA subtask, and the 'description' of the QA subtask must be the full content of the original task.\n20. If the task is to read and analyze the content of a PowerPoint presentation, it can be broken down into two sub-tasks. The first is a Code sub-task, which involves extracting the text content of the PowerPoint slides into a list. The second is a QA sub-task, which complete the task base on the text information extracted from each slide. \n21. Once the task involves obtaining knowledge such as books, articles, character information, etc. you need to plan API tasks to obtain this knowledge from the Internet.\n22. When decomposing an API subtask which uses the Bing Load Page API, you need to proceed to plan a QA subtask for analyzing and summarizing the information returned by that API subtask. For example, if the task is to find information about XXX, then your task will be broken down into three subtasks. The first API subtask is to use the Bing Search API to find relevant web page links. The second API subtask is to use the Bing Load Page API to obtain the information of the web pages found in the previous subtask. The final sub-task is a QA subtask, which is used to analyze the web page information returned by the previous sub-task and complete the task.\n23. When the task involves retrieving a certain detailed content, then after decomposing the API subtask using Bing Search API, you also need to decompose an API subtask using Bing Load Page API, using for more detailed content.\n24. If the attached file is a png or jpg file, the task must first be decomposed a API subtask, which uses image caption API to analyze image and solve problem. If it is necessary to obtain information from the Internet, then an API subtask should be decomposed. Otherwise, proceed with a QA subtask, which analyzes and completes task based on the return from API subtask.\n25. Please note that all available APIs are only in the API List. You should not make up APIs that are not in the API List.\n26. If the attached file is a mp3 file, you can only break out two subtasks! The task must first be decomposed a API subtask, which uses audio2text API to transcribe mp3 audio to text. Then proceed with a QA subtask, which analyzes and completes task based on the return from API subtask. \n27. Since the analyse or the content of the file are in the return value of the first subtask, if the following subtask requires the content or the analyse, the first subtask needs to be added to the dependencies of that subtask.\n28. If the task has a path to the file, then the subtask that operates the file must write the full path of the file in the task description, for example, add a new sheet, write calculation results into a certain column, etc.\n"
