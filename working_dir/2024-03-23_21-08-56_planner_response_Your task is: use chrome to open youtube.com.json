"To accomplish the task of using Chrome to open youtube.com on macOS, we can directly refer to the Action List provided. The action \"open_chrome_and_navigate\" seems to be a perfect fit for this task as it describes the operation to open Google Chrome on macOS and navigate to a specified URL. This task does not require the use of APIs, image analysis, video analysis, or QA operations since it's a straightforward system command execution. Therefore, we can decompose this task into a single Code subtask.\n\nGiven the task and the system version (macOS 14.4), we can proceed with the following reasoning:\n\n1. **Execute System Command to Open Chrome and Navigate to youtube.com**: This subtask involves executing a system command that leverages the \"open_chrome_and_navigate\" action from the Action List. The command will open Google Chrome and navigate directly to youtube.com. This is a Code subtask because it involves executing a system command on macOS.\n\nHere is the JSON representation of the decomposed subtask:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"open_chrome_and_navigate_to_youtube\": {\n    \"name\": \"open_chrome_and_navigate_to_youtube\",\n    \"description\": \"Execute a system command to open Google Chrome on macOS and navigate to youtube.com.\",\n    \"dependencies\": [],\n    \"type\": \"Code\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON structure represents the decomposed task into a subtask, detailing the operation to be performed, its dependencies, and its type. Since the task is straightforward and does not require multiple steps or dependencies, it is encapsulated in a single Code subtask."
