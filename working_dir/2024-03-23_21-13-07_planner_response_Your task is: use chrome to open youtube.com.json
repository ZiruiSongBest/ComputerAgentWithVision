"To accomplish the task of using Chrome to open youtube.com on macOS, we can directly utilize the action from the Action List provided. The action \"open_chrome_and_navigate\" is specifically designed to open Google Chrome on macOS and navigate to a specified URL. Since the task explicitly mentions navigating to youtube.com, this action is perfectly suited for our needs. Therefore, we can decompose this task into a single Code subtask that leverages this action.\n\nGiven the task's straightforward nature and the availability of a direct action in the Action List, there's no need for additional subtasks such as API calls, image or video tasks, or QA tasks. The action \"open_chrome_and_navigate\" encapsulates the entire operation required to complete the task, making it an atomic operation in this context.\n\nHere is the JSON representation of the decomposed subtask:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"open_chrome_and_navigate_to_youtube\": {\n    \"name\": \"open_chrome_and_navigate_to_youtube\",\n    \"description\": \"Execute a system command to open Google Chrome on macOS and navigate to youtube.com.\",\n    \"dependencies\": [],\n    \"type\": \"Code\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON structure outlines the subtask necessary to complete the given task, including the subtask's name, a description of the operation to be performed, the dependencies (which are none in this case, as it's a standalone operation), and the type of subtask, which is a Code subtask."
